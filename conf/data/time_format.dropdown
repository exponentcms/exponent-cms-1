# Date Format Drop Down File
#
# Comments start with a '#' sign,
# and must be the only thing on the line.
#
# Note: the %l (lowercase L) option is one I stumbled
# on by accident.
#
# Each entry in this file consists of two lines - the
#   first line is the date formatting argument to the
#   strftime function (http://php.net/strftime) and the
#   second is the name of the format, which will be provided
#   to the user when configuring.
#
# If you add entries to this file, I ask that you let me
# know, through our Sourceforge page. If you want or need
# a date format that isn't listed here, and you tell me, I
# will put it in the standard distribution.
