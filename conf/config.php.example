# Specify which database server software
# package your web server is running.
# Currently, only MySQL is supported
# 100%.  There is PostGreSQL support,
# but it is not completely stable.
# If in doubt, contact your system
# administrator or hosting provider.
#
# For PostGreSQL (USE AT OWN RISK)
#define("DB_ENGINE","postgres");
#
# For MySQL:
define("DB_ENGINE","mysql");




#######################################
#
# If your database server software runs
# on a different physical machine than
# the web server, enter the address of
# the database server machine.  Either
# an IP address (like 1.2.3.4) or an
# internet domain name will work.
#
# If your database server software runs
# on the same machine as the web server,
# use the default setting, 'localhost'.
#
# If in doubt, contact your system
# administrator or hosting provider.
#
# Example - IP Address:
#define("DB_HOST","1.2.3.4");
#
# Example - Domain Name:
#define("DB_HOST","db.example.com");
#
# Example - Default:
define("DB_HOST","localhost");




#######################################
#
# If you are using a database server that
# supports TCP or other network connection
# protocols, and that database software
# runs on a different physical machine than
# the web server, enter the connection port.
#
# If you set 'localhost' for DB_HOST field,
# you should leave this as the default setting.
#
# If in doubt, contact your system
# administrator or hosting provider.
#
# Default post for PostGreSQL:
#define("DB_PORT","5432");
#
# Default port for MySQL:
define("DB_PORT","3306");

# This is the real name of the database,

# Consult your system administrator or
# hosting provider if you are unsure and
# did not set the database up yourself.

#######################################
#
# All database server software supported
# by Exponent require some sort of authentication.
# Enter the name of the user account to use
# for logging into the database server.
#
define("DB_USER","not_configured");




#######################################
#
# Enter the password for the username you
# specified above.  The password will *not*
# be obscured, because it cannot be obscured
# in the configuration file.  The Exponent
# developers urge you to use a completely
# new password, unlike any of your others,
# for security reasons.
#

# A table prefix helps Exponent differentiate
# tables for this site from other tables that
# may already exist (or eventually be created
# by other scripts).  If you are using an
# existing database, you may want to change this.
