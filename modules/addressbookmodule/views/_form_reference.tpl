<div class="form_header">
When you reference a contact, you make a link from one address book into another.  The referenced contact will show up in both address books, and any changes made to the original will transfer to its references.
<br /><br />
No one can edit a reference contact.  If you need to change the information of a contact, you may want to <a class="mngmntlink addressbook_mngmntlink" href="{$copy_link}">copy</a> it.
