<div class="form_title">Copy Contact</div>
<div class="form_header">
Copying contacts places an exact duplicate of a contact form one address book into another.  Note that you can only copy contacts to Address Books you would be able to create a normal contact in.
<br /><br />
Since this will be a duplicate copy, you will be able to change the copied information.  However, any changes made to the original after you have copied it will not transfer to your copy.  If you want the changes to the original to carry over, you will want to <a class="mngmntlink addressbook_mngmntlink" href="{$ref_link}">reference</a> this contact instead.
