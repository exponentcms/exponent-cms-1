0.95.0-rc3 - Dec 07 2004
========================

0.95.0-rc2 - Nov 24 2004

 - This release candidate addresses bugs related to different system configuration, and should support versions of PHP back to 4.1.0.  It should also play nicely with either Linux or Windows.

(Note, if you are running this version on IIS, let me know what works and what doesn't, and I'll try to work on whatever problems you may encounter)
