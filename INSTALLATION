Installation of ExponentCMS 

Note about Upgrading: If you are upgrading, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you 
export your data and back up your files. 

If you are upgrading from any version prior to 0.96.3, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
that you do a clean install. The installer has changed substantially, and may 
act very strange if you try to extract 0.96.x over the top of anything other 
than a 0.96.x installation. 

1. Download the latest package 

The Exponent package is available in the following formats: 

The latest *stable* version of ExponentCMS is  exponent-0.98.0-20101105, available 
from the LaunchPad project page. https://launchpad.net/exponent-cms/+download 

Please check http://www.exponentcms.org for the latest available development 
release. 

2. Unpack the archive 

At this point, you have two options. You can unpack the archive locally and 
upload all of the files to the server, or you can upload the archive, and unpack 
it on the server.  It is recommended you install to the root web directory, 
but can be installed to test within a directory.

If you are running on a UNIX box, you can unpack the .zip archive like this: 

unzip -d /var/www/ exponent-VERSION.zip 

Exponent requires certain files and directories to be writable by the web server, 
and the standard distributions have this permission information preset. 
If you have root access to your webserver, you should also change ownership of the 
Exponent files to whatever user your webserver is running as. For example: 

chown -R apache:apache /var/www/ 

If you are unable to do this, you will have to adjust your file permissions in 
order to allow your webserver to write to certain directories (identified in the 
Installer Sanity checks). 

If your are using Windows and the .zip archive, the Exponent Development team 
recommends any of the following utilities: - the WinZip utility, downloadable 
from http://www.winzip.com/. - the Power Archiver utility from 
http://www.powerarchiver.com/. - the 7-up OpenSource utility, downloadable from 
http://www.7-zip.org/. 

The .zip archives have not yet been tested with Windows XP's built in zip 
support. 

Each archive will create the directory structure and contains all of the files 
used by Exponent. 

3. Database Creation & Setup

For security reasons, the Exponent Install Wizard is not able to create a 
database for you. This must be done outside of the system, before the wizard is 
run. How you do this is up to you (through command-line database client, 
phpMyAdmin, phpPgAdmin, etc.). 

It is recommended you create a new database for exponent.  If you've not already
created a database user account, go ahead and also do that.  The installer will 
ask you for name of the database to use, as well as a username and password for 
accessing the database. The user account you specify must have enough rights to 
perform normal database operations (like running SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE 
queries, etc.). The installation wizard will ensure that the provided account 
has these privileges. 

4. Running the Install Wizard 

Once you've completed the steps above, you need to start the web-based installer 
The program takes over the process of configuring and setting up the CMS. To 
access the installer and finish setting up, visit your website, and go to the 
directory that was unpacked. For instance, if your website (www.example.com) 
stores its files in /www/www.example.com/, and you unpacked the archive there, 
go to (http://www.example.com/) You'll need to also include the directory name 
if it was installed into a directory.  

From there, just follow the instructions and the Exponent Install Wizard will 
configure and set up your new Exponent site. It will help you through any
problems you may encounter along the way and then take you to your new web
site.
