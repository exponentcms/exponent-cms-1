-----------------------
# New editors!  The single most requested feature is now  implemented.  Not only do we have a new and better editor, but we have three new and better editors to choose from - FCKEditor, Xinha, and TinyMCE.  As of the alpha release, we are only shipping FCK for file size reasons, and TinyMCE needs a bit more work.  When 0.96.6 hits stable, we will offer all three editors either packaged with the core, or as add-ons.

Existing image managers are still supported, but you can now upload your image via the editor image selection interface, which saves quite a few clicks.
